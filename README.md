## AODN Core Pipeline
=
The aodncore.pipeline package provides the base class for each pipeline handler, aodncore.pipeline.HandlerBase. This is the starting point for any new handler development, as it contains all of the core functionality of each handler, which is then available to the child class via class inheritance.
